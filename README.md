# Linear_Regression_Project
Analysis of Algorithmic prediction Hotel Tips data set, build the Linear Regression model with the help of machine learning model.
#Problem Statement:  
The Organization wants for hotel_industrys, consumer/spending tips fpr rupees per servant by taking "total_bills",tips as a training data, predict what was happen in a future for "price_per_person"
##tasks

import the libraries which is required for prediction
import the dataset your using workspace
use the approprite arguement of sklearn librry to train,test,split the dataset
use the approprite arguement of sklearn librry to train,test,split the dataset
Chech ur model accuracy and precison using confusion matrix
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
classifier = LogisticRegression(random_state = 0)
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)

##CONCLUSIONS
ACCORDING TO THE MODEL ANALYSIS THE LOGISTIC REGRESION ALGORITHM WORKS SUCCESSFULLY WITH 0.6 ACCURACY.
THE ACCURACY SHOWS THAT BUILDING THE MODEL IS SUCCEEFUL
